Snowy white fox of the Arctic,
was it your brush-like tail
that sprayed snow, like crystal sparks,
adorning the dark sky with a shimmering veil?
Are you the Northern Lights?

Flourishing forest fungi,
was it your luminescent glow
that ignited fires across the frozen North,
covering the woodland floor, so very long ago?
Are you the Northern Lights?

Plentiful waters of Lapland
was it the light falling into your seas,
that reflected back off the fishes shiny, wet scales
into the streams of the sky? If so please,
Are you the Northern lights?

Or was it the solar winds that, colliding with earth's gasses,
started to glow, creating streamers in their masses?
A magnificent array of colours. Reds, greens, violets, blues,
A mystical curtain of  bright celestial hues.
Constantly in motion.
A beautiful blaze of auroral displays
Around Heaven's swirling ocean.
